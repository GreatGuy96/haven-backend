Haven is an opensource website (haven.bio) that provides various features that allow users to connect all their social media accounts in one place, generate short vanity links for their profile and post descriptions and most importantly, quickly describe themselves with a portfolio-like profile! Haven's backend is going to be built with Go and PostgreSQL and the frontend is going to be built with NextJS and TailwindCSS. Currently, our main aim is to roll out an MVP and open up the project to outside contributions, then we're going to work on the fine parts and make the website as customizable as possible so people can show themselves the way they want to.
